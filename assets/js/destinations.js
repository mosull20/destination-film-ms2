        `<p>Dettifoss (Falling Waterfall) is an amazing waterfall. No wonder Riddley Scott chose this
            spectacular
            scenery
            to be the background of the opening scene of his movie Prometheus (2012). Dettifoss is europes
            biggest
            waterfall by volume.
            It is situated in the north eastern part of Iceland in Icelands biggest national park.
            Hiking trails lead you through a series of other little less known waterfalls but each and every
            one
            an
            eye candy on its own.
            Selfoss and Hafragilsfoss are close runner ups.

The primary goal of the website from a user's perspective is to find out about some interesting places to visit where they could see some famous filming locations, thus combining their love of film with their love of travel!

### Design

The aim with the design of this project is to present the user with an elegant, visually appealing, easy to navigate website that draws attention to the beautiful locations being showcased.  From the destinations page, the user can explore all the different locations in detail without an overload of information being shown all at once. The aim is to provide the user with a calm feeling when exploring the site, ensuring the user does not feel overwhelemed when exploring the content. 
The images used were chosen carefully to engage the user and encourage the user to want to explore the site and content at their own pace. 
I used a filter on the images both ensure the content overlaying it would be easier to read and I also feel this contributes to a more consistent look across the site and the images have a slightly uniform feel. 
I chose the Josefin Sans font from Google Fonts with the aim of giving the content a spophisticated, elegant feel. I chose a cursive font for the quotes displaying, specifically Caveat font, to make it stand out from the rest of the content. 
The final design has differed from the wireframes based on what I felt worked better to provide a better, more consistent experience for the user. Specifically on the destinations page, where in the wireframes the details would drop down underneath that country, I ultimately felt it worked better to have that detail in the one section underneath all the countries and implemented scrolling to that section when the user clicks. I also implemented a modal to display when the user has sent the contact form rather than the pop-up box in the wireframes. Again, I felt this improved the user experience.

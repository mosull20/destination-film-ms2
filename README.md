Destination Film is a travel inspiration website focusing specifically on countries often used as filming locations for many famous film and tv shows. 
It showcases a number of destinations, giving an overview about what has been filmed there, what places to visit in particular.

The primary goal of the website from the site owner's perspective is to provide film and tv fans with some ideas for their next holiday to visit places they have seen on screen in their favourite tv shows or films. 

The primary goal of the website from a user's perspective is to find out about some interesting places to visit where they could see some famous filming locations, thus combining their love of film with their love of travel!

### Design

#### Overall Design
The aim with the design of this project is to present the user with an elegant, visually appealing, easy to navigate website that draws attention to the beautiful locations being showcased.  From the destinations page, the user can explore all the different locations in detail without an overload of information being shown all at once. The aim is to provide the user with a calm feeling when exploring the site, ensuring the user does not feel overwhelemed when exploring the content.
The overall design is to present the user with a site they can engage and interact with, clicking on different areas to discover more content.
For the contact page, I chose to add in a little interest for the user by having a section displaying some repeating quotes that the user may find interesting. These quotes were chosen specifically to connect the theme of travelling with film and televsion. 
#### Images
The images used were chosen carefully to engage the user and encourage the user to want to explore the site and content at their own pace. 
I used a filter on the images both ensure the content overlaying it would be easier to read and I also feel this contributes to a more consistent look across the site and the images have a slightly uniform feel with the colors in the photo more toned down than vivid.
#### Typefont
I chose the Josefin Sans font from Google Fonts with the aim of giving the content a spophisticated, elegant feel. I chose a cursive font for the quotes displaying, specifically Caveat font, to make it stand out from the rest of the content. 
#### Note about Wireframes
The final design has differed from the wireframes based on what I felt worked better to provide a better, more consistent experience for the user. Specifically on the destinations page, where in the wireframes the details would drop down underneath that country, I ultimately felt it worked better to have that detail in the one section underneath all the countries and implemented scrolling to that section when the user clicks. I also implemented a modal to display when the user has sent the contact form rather than the pop-up box in the wireframes. Again, I felt this improved the user experience. 

## Features
#### Existing Features
* Home Page
  + Navigation bar with simple company name (linked back to home page), and links to each of the 3 pages. This will be consistent through all pages wiht consistent transparent styling.
  + Landing area to take full screen when site opened with headline and short explanation of the site overlayed over a background image. Link to 'learn more' which will scroll users down to next section of home page for a further explanation of what the site is about, along with a link to click to the destionations page.
  + Footer which will be consistent across all pages. Footer simply contains a link to the contact page, links fo social media (home pages only as this website is created for the purposes if the Code Institute project and so does not have a social media prescence), and copyright info. 

* Destinations Page
  + Nav Bar as above 
  + Five main sections with country name and arrow to encourage user to click to reveal relevant info for each country. 
  + On reveal the section with the country info contains a short introduction to the country's background as a film and tv location, mentioning what shows have been filmed there and then encourages the user to click through to see all five places of interest. This section will also show the current weather for the capital city, along with a map with the places of interest mentioned marked and named. Each place of interest box has an image and some content to detail what makes these places of interest with regard in particular to film and tv. 
  + The section will show one country at a time determined by what the user has last clicked on. 
  + Footer as before
  + This page makes use of a weather api, maps api as well as using JavaScript to encourage user interaction to explore rather than presenting a large amount of information all at once. 

* Contact page
  + Nav Bar as above
  + Contact Form using emailjs to handle the contact form submission. 
  + Modal displays on submission of the form to let the user know if their message has been sent successfully or if there has been an error. 
  + Interesting travel related quotes from films displayed in repeating, random order (10 in total on repeat). 
  + Footer as above


### Features Left to Implement 

There are two features which this project may benefit from in the future, outside of the project assessment timeline. 

1. A regular Blog post - including taking contributions from users of their own experiences. This would keep the content current and changing so users will come back to check out the latest posts.
2. Add a flight and accommodation booking service/api so users could begin all aspects of planning a trip without having to leave the site.

### Code

I also used a site called [thisinterestsme.com](https://thisinterestsme.com/change-src-image-javascript/) re changing src attribute and I used these 2 lines for code from here (where indicated in weather.js file). 

+ Destinations.js file - Code here to handle the different places of interest in each country was refactored from what I originally wrote to make it slightly shorter and more logical. Functionality remained the same. My mentor (Nishant Kumar) provided me assistance in rewriting this section (as noted in the js file).

+ Code for inserting favicon as used in my previous MS1 project and orignally sourced then from a Youtube video by Dani Krossing as recommended by Anna Greaves (Code Institute) in her MS1 helper documents.
